OPC-UA Data Pipeline: Final Project 
Assignment 
 
Overview 
For your final project, you will design and implement a complete end-to-
end data pipeline that collects real-time industrial data from an OPC-UA 
simulation server, processes it through multiple layers, and visualizes the 
results in a monitoring dashboard. This project demonstrates your 
understanding of IoT data ingestion, stream processing, time-series 
databases, and data visualization. 
In total, there are 100 points to be gained in this assignment. The points are 
split into the following categories: 
Category # of points 
OPC-UA simulation server 30 
Data Pipeline 20 
TimescaleDB table structure 5 
TimescaleDB continuous aggregate 15 
Grafana Dashboard 15 
Documentation 15 
Project Objectives 
By completing this project, you will: 
➢ Build a working OPC-UA simulation server 
➢ Design and implement a multi-stage data pipeline with message 
brokers and event enrichment 
➢ Configure a time-series database for efficient storage and querying 
➢ Create real-time visualizations of industrial data 
➢ Package all parts of the data Pipeline in a single docker compose 
setup for easy testing & deployment.

Project components 
OPC-UA Simulation Server (30 Points) 
Implement a functional OPC-UA simulation server in a programming 
language of your choice. Your server must accurately represent all fields 
specified in one of the machine descriptions provided during the course. 
The server should simulate realistic data variations and maintain stable 
connections for continuous data transmission. 
Data Pipeline (20 Points) 
Your data pipeline must consist of four integrated components: 
OPC-UA to MQTT Agent: Create an agent that reads data from your OPC-
UA simulation server and converts it to MQTT protocol for transmission to a 
message broker. 
MQTT Broker: Set up and configure an MQTT broker that acts as the central 
hub for initial data distribution. 
Hydration Agent: Implement an agent that retrieves context data from 
Redis, enriches incoming MQTT events with this contextual information, 
and publishes the enriched events to a Kafka queue. 
Kafka to Database Agent: Build an agent that consumes messages from 
your Kafka queue and writes the data to your PostgreSQL database. 
All components must work together seamlessly, with proper error handling 
and data validation at each stage. 
TimescaleDB table structure (5 Points) 
Create a correctly configured TimescaleDB hypertable optimized for your 
time-series data. The table schema should reflect the fields from your 
machine description and include appropriate data types, constraints, and 
indexes. Clearly document your table structure, including all columns, their 
purposes, and any design decisions you made. 
Continuous aggregate (15 Points) 
Set up a continuous aggregate on your TimescaleDB hypertable that 
performs regular time-based aggregations of your data (e.g., hourly, daily). 
This aggregate should compute meaningful statistics such as averages, 
minimums, maximums, or other relevant metrics. Document your 
aggregation strategy and explain how it supports your visualization needs.

Grafana Dashboard (15 Points) 
Create a Grafana dashboard that visualizes data from your TimescaleDB 
table. Your dashboard must include: 
Short-term visualization: Graphs showing recent data (e.g., last 24 hours) 
to monitor current system behavior 
Long-term visualization: Graphs showing historical trends (e.g., last 
month or longer) to identify patterns and trends 
Your dashboard should be intuitive, well-labeled, and use appropriate chart 
types for your data. 
 
Project documentation (15 Points) 
Provide comprehensive documentation that includes: 
OPC-UA Server Overview: A description of all available fields in your OPC-
UA simulation server and what they represent. 
System Architecture: Links to all relevant user interfaces (Redpanda 
console, Grafana dashboard, etc.) and a complete list of ports used by 
each service. 
Database Schema: A clear explanation of your TimescaleDB table 
structure, including all columns and their meanings. 
Continuous Aggregate Details: Documentation of how your continuous 
aggregate is configured, what time intervals it uses, and what metrics it 
computes. 
Grafana Configuration: Descriptions of your dashboard panels, the 
queries used, and how to interpret the visualizations.

Submission Requirements 
 
Submit your project as a complete package including: 
➢ All source code for the OPC-UA server and pipeline agents 
➢ Database schema and setup scripts 
➢ Grafana dashboard configuration (exported as JSON) 
➢ Complete documentation file (PDF or Markdown format) 
➢ A README file with instructions for running your System 
➢ A docker-compose.yaml file to run the entire stack 
For your submission you can either 
a) Provide a link to a Github repository containing all the relevant files 
b) Upload all required files as a zip archive 
 
Final remarks 
 
➢ All components should run reliably for extended periods without 
manual Intervention 
➢ Provide a Dockerfile for your OPC-UA Server so that it can be built 
during testing 
➢ Test your entire pipeline end-to-end before submission to ensure data 
flows correctly through all stages 
➢ Include comments in your code explaining complex logic
